#
# This header.mak file will set up all necessary options for compiling
# and linking C and C++ programs which use OpenGL and/or GLUT on the
# Ubuntu systems.
#
# To use it, place it in the same directory as your source code, and
# run the command
#
#       gmakemake > Makefile
#
# To compile and link your program, just run "make".
#
# If you want to take advantage of GDB's extra debugging features,
# change "-g" in the CFLAGS and LIBFLAGS macro definitions to "-ggdb".
